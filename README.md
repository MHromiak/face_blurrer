# Face blurrer


A short project to get myself familiar with basic computer vision models and techniques. Faces are recognized and blurred from
livestreamed video, prerecorded video, and single images. 



## Example Command Prompts

- `python main.py`                
    runs livestream face blurring

- `python main.py -h`             
    prints usage help

- `python main.py -video $path`   
    blurs video at specified path

- `python main.py -image $path`   
    blurs image at specified path
